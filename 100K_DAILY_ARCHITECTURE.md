# 🚀 Architecture for 100K Events/Day

## Current Problem
- 300K posts crashed Supabase (free tier limit ~10K active rows)
- Targeting 100K events/day = 36.5M events/year
- Need enterprise-grade architecture

## 🏗️ Scalable Architecture Options

### **Option 1: Supabase Pro + Optimized Storage** 💰 $25-100/month
```
Daily: 100K events → Weekly cleanup → 30-day rolling window
Storage: ~3M active posts max (100K × 30 days)
```

**Pros:**
- Keeps current Supabase setup
- Relatively simple migration
- Built-in auth, real-time, etc.

**Cons:**
- Still expensive at scale
- May hit limits eventually

### **Option 2: Hybrid: Railway + PostgreSQL** 💰 $50-200/month
```
Railway (Processing) + Dedicated PostgreSQL + Supabase (Auth/API)
```

**Architecture:**
```
Ingestion → Railway Processing → PostgreSQL → Supabase (minimal)
                ↓
         Time-series partitioning
         Automatic archiving
         Read replicas
```

### **Option 3: Full Railway + TimescaleDB** 💰 $100-300/month
```
Complete migration to Railway with time-series database
```

**Best for 100K+ daily events**

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED: Option 2 - Hybrid Architecture**

### **Phase 1: Immediate Fix (Today)**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor, run multiple times:
DELETE FROM posts 
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM posts 
  ORDER BY created_at ASC 
  LIMIT 10000
);
```

### **Phase 2: Implement Rolling Window (This Week)**
```javascript
// Keep only last 30 days, archive rest
const RETENTION_DAYS = 30;
const MAX_ACTIVE_POSTS = 100000; // 100K max in active table

// Daily cleanup job
function cleanupOldData() {
  // Archive posts older than 30 days
  // Keep active table under 100K rows
}
```

### **Phase 3: Partition Strategy (Next Week)**
```sql
-- Partition by month for better performance
CREATE TABLE posts_2025_01 (LIKE posts INCLUDING ALL);
CREATE TABLE posts_2025_02 (LIKE posts INCLUDING ALL);
-- etc.

-- Auto-route new posts to current partition
-- Archive old partitions to cold storage
```

### **Phase 4: Scale to Railway PostgreSQL (Month 2)**
```
Current: Supabase (overloaded)
New: Railway PostgreSQL + Supabase (auth only)

Benefits:
- Dedicated resources
- Time-series partitioning  
- Automatic archiving
- Read replicas for analytics
```

## 📊 **100K Daily Events - Resource Planning**

### **Database Requirements:**
```
Daily: 100,000 posts
Monthly: ~3,000,000 posts  
Storage per post: ~2KB average
Monthly storage: ~6GB raw data
With indexes: ~12GB total
```

### **Processing Requirements:**
```
Ingestion: 100K posts/day = 1.2 posts/second average
Peak: 10x average = 12 posts/second
Enrichment: 100K OpenAI calls/day = $200-400/day
Ideas generation: 1K clusters/day = $50-100/day
```

### **Cost Breakdown (Monthly):**
```
Database: $100-200 (Railway PostgreSQL)
AI Processing: $6,000-12,000 (OpenAI)
Infrastructure: $50-100 (Railway services)
Total: $6,150-12,300/month
```

## 🛠️ **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Today (Emergency):**
1. **Run SQL cleanup directly in Supabase**
2. **Stop all ingestion services** 
3. **Reduce ingestion to 1,000 posts/day** until fixed

### **This Week:**
1. **Implement rolling 30-day window**
2. **Add automatic daily cleanup** 
3. **Monitor database size daily**
4. **Test with 5K posts/day**

### **Next Month:**
1. **Migrate to Railway PostgreSQL**
2. **Implement time-series partitioning**
3. **Add read replicas for analytics**
4. **Scale to target 100K/day**

## 🚨 **Critical Success Factors**

### **1. Data Lifecycle Management**
```
Hot data: Last 7 days (fast access)
Warm data: 8-30 days (normal access)  
Cold data: 30+ days (archived/compressed)
```

### **2. Processing Optimization**
```
Batch ingestion: Process in 1K batches
Smart filtering: Pre-filter before storage
Deduplication: Prevent duplicate processing
```

### **3. Monitoring & Alerts**
```
Database size > 80% capacity → Alert
Processing queue > 1 hour behind → Alert  
Error rate > 5% → Stop ingestion
```

## 💡 **Revenue Model Impact**

### **At 100K Events/Day:**
```
Processing cost: ~$8,000/month
Target revenue: $20,000+/month
Pricing: $200-500/user/month (enterprise)
Break-even: 40-100 enterprise users
```

### **Optimization Strategies:**
```
1. Smart filtering (reduce 100K → 10K quality posts)
2. Tiered processing (basic vs premium analysis)
3. Batch discounts (10K posts = $0.50, 100K = $0.30)
```

**🚀 Key Insight: 100K events/day requires enterprise architecture, but also enables enterprise pricing ($200-500/month). The infrastructure cost becomes a competitive moat!**
