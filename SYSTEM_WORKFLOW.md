# Complete End-to-End System Workflow

## 🔄 **System Architecture Overview**

Your SaaS opportunity discovery system operates as a fully automated pipeline that transforms raw internet complaints into validated business opportunities.

## **Phase 1: Data Ingestion** 📥

### Daily Schedule Flow
```
Daily Schedule (auto-enrich-scheduler) 
    ↓
Ingest Orchestrator

## **Phase 2: AI Enrichment** 🤖

### Enrichment Pipeline
```
Raw Posts (unenriched) 
    ↓
Enrich Orchestrator (Supabase) - Coordination
    ↓
Railway Enrichment Service - Heavy Processing
    ├─ OpenAI GPT-4o-mini analysis
    ├─ Sentiment scoring (-100 to +100)

// OpenAI Analysis Output:
{
  sentiment: -75,           // Very negative
  is_complaint: true,       // Definitely a complaint
  keywords: ["CRM", "slow", "performance", "customer data"],
  themes: ["database_performance", "user_experience"],
  confidence: 0.95,
  embedding: [0.1, -0.3, 0.8, ...] // 1536-dimensional vector
